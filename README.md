Problem Statement

Choosing a restaurant is often harder than it should be.

- Family dinners at couple-oriented cafés
- Friends meetups at quiet family restaurants
- Budget mismatches and ambience confusion

AAO-LO solves this by **clearly categorizing restaurants** based on suitability and preferences, reducing poor dining experiences.
